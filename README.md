# classwork
A sample of classwork.

This repository is intended to serve as a representation of my completed coursework to be viewed by potential employers.

The JAVA files are from a Data Structures and Algorithms course, the C file is from Introduction to Computer Organization, and the Python file is from part
of a project I did to help a real estate company transfer all of their data to a new accounting system.
